# Layer 1 DEX Application

## Requirements
- Create a decentralized exchange (DEX) interface for a Layer 1 blockchain
- Implement token swap functionality with price charts
- Display liquidity pools and allow users to add/remove liquidity
- Show transaction history for the connected wallet
- Implement wallet connection functionality
- Display real-time market data including token prices and trading volumes
- Implement a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Create a clean, modern UI with dark mode support

## Design
The application will be built as a single-page React application with the following architecture:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - Navbar with wallet connection
   - Token swap interface
   - Liquidity pools management
   - Price charts and market data
   - Transaction history
   - Settings panel

2. **State Management**:
   - Use React context for global state (wallet connection, selected tokens)
   - Use React Query for data fetching and caching

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Mock blockchain interaction for demonstration purposes
   - Simulate token swaps and liquidity operations
   - Use static data for initial development, with hooks for future real blockchain integration

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Modern, clean interface with dark mode
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - Clear feedback for user actions
   - Loading states and error handling

## Discussions
- Initial project setup will focus on creating a functional UI with mock data
- Since Supabase is not connected, we'll use client-side state management and mock data
- For a production DEX, blockchain integration would require connection to actual Layer 1 nodes
- The application will be designed to be easily extended with real blockchain functionality in the future
